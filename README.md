This is the first project in The Odin Project web dev foundations course.
=========================================================================

The project itself is a clone of the Google homepage. This project will enhance
my understanding of the following:

* Using Git and Github to manage project files as well as publish the completed project.

* Getting comfortble with basic tools like using a color picker. 

* Start the process of learning Google-Fu i.e working on the ability to look for the answers needed
  to complete the project if you are lost or confused

* Begin learning the basics of moving elements around 

* Learn about basic page structure and layout

* Build your first "form" i.e the query box Google is known for

* How to stick a div to the top or bottom of a page (fixed pos)

* Understand the basics around classes and ids and why we use them, how they are useful.

* First attempts at asking questions of other developers will happen- this is a chance to practice
  asking thoughtful questions and interacting with the greater dev community

* This will allow me to practice building and organizing the structure of a project
